# CrackScan: Enabling Intelligent Edge Inspection with UAVs for Structural Health Monitoring


# Overview:

CrackScan is an advanced AI-powered crack segmentation system designed for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). It utilizes deep learning (YOLOv8), image processing (OpenCV), and edge computing (Raspberry Pi 4) to automate crack detection, segmentation, dimension quantification, and severity classification in real time. Moreover, it includes real-time face blurring system to enhance privacy in urban settings.


# Key Features:

  1. AI-Driven Crack Detection: Uses YOLOv8 for high-precision segmentation with 98.29% F1-score.
  2. Automated Crack Quantification: Measures crack length and width using pixel-to-physical conversion.
  3. Severity Classification: Categorizes cracks into six levels based on dimensions.
  4. UAV Integration: Uses drones for image acquisition, reducing manual inspection efforts.
  5. Edge Computing: Runs on Raspberry Pi 4, enabling on-site analysis.
  6. Privacy-Preserving AI: Implements real-time face blurring to protect privacy.


# Results: 

  1. Precision: 98.6%
  2. Recall: 98%
  3. F1-Score: 98.29%
  4. mAP-50: 89.9%


# Deployment in UAV:

  1. CrackScan was successfully deployed using DJI Air 2s with Raspberry Pi 4.
  2. Achieved an average processing time of 2s per image.
  3. Validated through field tests on real structures.
